#CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has proven highly successful for patients with B-cell malignancies. However, a substantial fraction of patients still presents with primary resistance while others relapse quickly after CAR-T treatment. In this study, we investigated the transcriptional profile of individual third generation CD19 CAR-T infusion products using targeted single-cell RNA sequencing. This repository display the analysis of the single-cell RNA sequencing data obtained from the individual CAR-T infusion products used to treat the patients in this study.
